This is a program designed to test strategies for the game theory game Buisness Entry.
The game works as follows:
    It takes eight people to play
    Every round a number which will be called "c" is selected randomly from either 2, 4, or 6
    The eight players secretly decide without discussion whether or not they will "enter the buisness"
    Anyone who doesn't enter the buisness gets one point
    But if you do enter the buisness you get two points if the total number of people who entered is less than or equal to c otherwise you get none
